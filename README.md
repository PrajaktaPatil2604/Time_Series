Introduction 

Brief Background: We have used time series analysis to forecast the behavior of the users based on their engagement activities on an OTT platform and leveraging the information to predict whether a given spectator would continue his/her subscription or not. Time Series analysis is a powerful tool to employ these functionalities. It would play a crucial role in understanding user engagement patterns and developing strategies to attract more spectators to the platforms. 

Motivation: The businesses like OTT platforms or gyms rely on the steady revenue that is given by their clients. Therefore, a model for predicting whether a user will renew his/ her subscription is an important step for creating better business strategies like offering personalized deals. Most of the datasets focus only on basic customer details but looking into more time-based datasets, like user-activity and payment history, gives a clearer image of users' behaviors. 

 
2. Objective(s) 
1. Predict Subscription Renewal: A model is developed to predict whether a user will renew their subscription or not. 
2. Analyze User Behavior: Key patterns and trends will be identified to know what influences user’s behaviour. 
3. Enhance Retention Strategies: The analysis would help in creating personalized deals for the users to engage more spectators. 
4. Improve Forecasting Accuracy: Time-series techniques would be used to provide precise predictions. 
5. Simulate Real-World Scenarios: To have a better image additional synthetic data would be incorporated to have a better view and efficient results.
